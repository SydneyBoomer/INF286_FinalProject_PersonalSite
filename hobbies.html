            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <h5>Why I Love Reading:</h5>
            <p>It allows me to escape into worlds filled with endless possibilities and imagination.  Books have a unique way of transporting me to places I’ve never been and introducing me to new things.</p>
            <h5>Origination:</h5>
            <p>My love of reading began as a family tradition, with my parents reading to me every night when I was little.  In second grade, everything changed when I heard the audiobook of <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</i>.  I immediately dove into the rest of the series which sparked my passion for reading and opened the door to a lifetime of exploring new worlds through books.</p>
            <h5>Favorites:</h5>
            <p>Sarah J. Maas is my favorite author because her stories have an incredible way of pulling me into their worlds.  I was first introduced to her writing when I was gifted the first two books of the <i>Throne of Glass</i> series, and I instantly fell in love with the complex characters and thrilling plot.  I eagerly awaited each new release, devouring the rest of the series as soon as they came out.  Her <i>A Court of Thorns and Roses</i> series was equally captivating, with its rich storytelling and emotional depth.</p>

            <p>It’s the perfect way to unwind and immerse myself in captivating stories.  I enjoy how it brings characters to life in a way that feels personal and relatable, often sparking conversations or even new interests.  Watching TV is also a way to connect with friends and family, sharing favorite shows or binge-watching together.</p>
            <h5>Favorites:</h5>
            <p><i>Iron Man</i> is my favorite movie because it perfectly combines thrilling action with groundbreaking technology.  The sleek design of the Iron Man suit, the innovative AI like J.A.R.V.I.S., and the futuristic gadgets all showcase the power of human ingenuity.  The way the movie brings advanced tech to life feels both believable and awe-inspiring.

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <h5>Why I Love Gaming:</h5>
            <p>I’ve always had a deep love for gaming, whether it’s board games, card games, or video games.  My family and I have a tradition of playing Buck and Euchre every week, and we always enjoy family game nights where each of us picks a game to play.  Board games like Clue, Sequence, and Taboo never fail to bring us closer, and we’re always up for some friendly competition.</p>
            <h5>Favorites:</h5>
            <p>When it comes to video games, the Nintendo Switch is our go-to.  We love playing Splatoon 2 and Overcooked together, enjoying both the fast-paced action and the team-based challenges.  As for my personal favorites, Animal Crossing and Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the Switch are top of the list.  There’s something about the immersive worlds and the creativity involved that keeps me coming back for more.</p>

            <h2>Travelling</h2>
            <h5>Why I Love Travelling:</h5>
            <p>For most of my life, my family has taken an annual vacation outside of Ohio, where we live.  These trips have given me the chance to explore various states and experience different cultures.  I don’t count just spending the night on the way to another state, but rather the states I’ve visited and truly experienced.  One of the most memorable trips was in June 2022, when my sister and I traveled to London, England, Paris, France, and Barcelona, Spain.  These cities offered me new perspectives and unforgettable memories that I will cherish forever.<br>(For pictures: see <a href="about.html#iTrips">About Page</a>)</p>
            <h5>Upcoming Trips:</h5>
            <p>I’m also excited for my upcoming travels!  In December 2024, I have the incredible opportunity to study abroad in Athens, Greece, where I will dive deep into Greek mythology and experience the rich history firsthand.  Following that, in June 2027, my friend and I are planning a trip to Tokyo, Japan, after we graduate.  I can’t wait to immerse myself in the unique culture of Japan, explore the bustling city, and make more lasting memories with my friend.</p>
